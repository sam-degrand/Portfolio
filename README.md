AS A POTENTIAL CANDIDATE
I WANT to show a potential employer a deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can preview samples of my work and to show why I am a good candidate for the open position
```

```
GIVEN A potential employer needs a sample of my work
WHEN They load my portfolio
THEN They are presented with my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
WHEN They click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN They click on the link to the section about my work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications
WHEN They are presented with my first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN They click on the images of the applications
THEN They are taken to that deployed application
WHEN They resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN They presented with a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport
